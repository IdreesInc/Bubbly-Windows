# Bubbly Windows

A webpage that has bubbles crossing through the background of different elements without being visible in the space between. Works by creating duplicates of those bubbles in each element and hiding them in the overflow until their visible. By setting the duration of each animation proportional to the height of the element (and all proceeding elements), the speed is the same between all bubbles in different elements.

Uses [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for the animations, but this can be removed by using CSS animations instead.
